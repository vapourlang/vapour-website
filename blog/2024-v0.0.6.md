# v0.0.6

Bug fixes galore and a first major change.

<!-- truncate -->

## Bug fixes

You can take a look at the [changelog](/changelog)
and the [release](https://github.com/vapourlang/vapour/releases/tag/v0.0.5)
to get a full view of the fixes.

The bugs are mainly oversights on my part and trying/hoping that
the tree-walker/type checking can be stricter:
some of the constraints in place were erroneous.
Thanks to [Elian Hugh](https://github.com/ElianHugh) for raising
many of them.

## NA type

The `na` type is gone.

I'm not a fan of `NA` in R, I know it's one of its strength
but it can throw things off sometimes, so my initial thought
(and what's in the initial release of Vapour) is to have an
`na` type such that we have to be explicit when a vector may
contain `NA` values.

Oh boy was that wrong...

Thanks to [Jonathan Carroll](https://github.com/jonocarroll) and
[Lukas Jung](https://github.com/lhdjung) we have a better
understanding of how this should work, though of course
the night is still young and things may change in the future.

You can go through
[#62](https://github.com/vapourlang/vapour/issues/62),
it's a good read if you're a nerd.

In brief, Lukas points out the following in R:

```r
length(letters) # 26

letters[27] # NA
```

This really can't be handled at build time since the length
of the vector can only be known at run time, therefore
any vector can technically return `NA`.

Then Jonathan correctly hints at the fact that `NA` is not
really a type in R, it's a special value.
This missing value can have a type, e.g.: `NA_character_`.

Therefore, the `na` type has been removed.

Thanks again to anyone who helped improve the project!
